Preceptor \u015aa\u1e45karendra (Arbhaka\u015ba\u1e45kara), after installing M\u0101t\u1e5bgupta, the ardent follower of theprecepts of var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama (enjoined for respective classes of people) attained Siddhi on the full moon day in the month of \u015arava\u1e47a of the \u015aaka year 359. (In the sanskrit and tamil explanations on Pages 22 & 23, Matrugupta appears to be a patron of Sankarendra along with Ramilla, Sri Harsha etc.)."
