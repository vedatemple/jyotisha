He decorated the seat by remaining in K\u0101\u1e45ci only for seventy-three years and after directing eight disciples who shone like the presiding deities of eight quarters to take care of the P\u012b\u1e6dha, He, the steadfast one, resorting to the peaks of Himalayas with the only companion disciple, \u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101nanda, observed severe penance for fifteen years. This preceptor, in the course of penance itself, as the attending disciple was looking at, merged in the Supreme Effulgence of the Sun on the pratipad (first day) of the bright fortnight of the M\u0101gha month in the year rakt\u0101k\u1e63\u012b. The disciple too afflicted with grief heavily returned to his Ma\u1e6dha. In the meantime, the eight disciples too protected the P\u012b\u1e6dha as per the directions; gladdened on seeing the disciple \u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101nanda, they entered into that Ma\u1e6dha of their preceptor. This preceptor, adored by \u015ar\u012b Vidy\u0101ra\u1e47ya, Saccid\u0101nanda and others is also known popularly as Vidy\u0101n\u0101tha, Vidye\u015ba, Vidy\u0101\u015ba\u1e45kara, Vidy\u0101t\u012brtha and \u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101nandaguru."
