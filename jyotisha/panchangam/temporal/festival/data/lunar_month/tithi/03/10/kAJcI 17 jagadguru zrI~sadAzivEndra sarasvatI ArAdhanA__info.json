Being carried by her (river Sindhu) He (Sad\u0101\u015bivab\u0101la) was given to a brahmin endowed with austerities saying \u201cpleased by your austerities/penance today this boy/child is given\u201d; then being asked/enquired by Bh\u016brivasu of Pushpapura and initiated by him\u2014the saviour\u2014father, He held high the school of nondualism.
