    "en": "This preceptor was the son of Vi\u015bvajit of Cidambaram through vi\u015bi\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101; like the Sun who dispels the dense darkness veiling his presence, He was born on the tenth day of the bright fortnight in the month of Vai\u015b\u0101kha in the year Vibhava twelve months after his father\u2019s demise. One who was abandoned as a child in the midst of a forest by his mother herself without any possible solution to her deplorable plight, viz., widowhood, lack of shelter, servitude, insult of relatives fear of slander etc. Who, on crying at a distance was taken by the wife of Vy\u0101ghrap\u0101da, to her home and was compassionately breastfed by her after informing her husband. The sage initiated him and imparted the \u0101tmavidy\u0101. Then, the adept in self control/ascetic principles, having completed studies, well-versed in scriptures, having received the grace bestowed by the Universal Preceptor (\u015ar\u012b \u015aa\u1e45kara) who manifested of his will before (him), and having received the mighty sacred sandals (of \u015ar\u012b \u015aa\u1e45kara) offered by Padmap\u0101da appearing by the side of \u015ar\u012b \u015aa\u1e45kara, He (the Dh\u012bra\u015ba\u1e45kara) stayed in Tilvara\u1e47ya. The Universal Preceptor having adorned the seat of K\u0101maP\u012b\u1e6dha, He wandered through the earth triumphant of having wiped off the arrogance of the adherents/scholars of rival schools in eight quarters (of the earth) and established the doctrine of Advaita. He \u015aa\u1e45karendra, having conquered easily the Kashmiri scholars Girodbha\u1e6d\u1e6da and others, ascended the Sarvaj\u00f1aP\u012b\u1e6dha in Kashmir and though being followed by disciples to the \u0100treya caves (in the Himalayas), disappeared alive in the embodied form itself. Thus, the preceptor sage spreading/showering the tenets of Advaya on this sacred earth for fifty-two years and with a desire to spread this noble path in the other world, He disappeared on the new moon day in the month of \u0100\u1e63\u0101\u1e0dha of the Uttaraya\u1e47a in the year Siddh\u0101rthi of Kali era 3914. The sage Saccidvil\u0101sa became the preceptor. This preceptor is tur\u012byat\u012bta-\u015aa\u1e45kara. Some scholars mistake him to be \u015ar\u012b \u015aa\u1e45kara Bhagavadp\u0101da and compile biography with inconsistencies."
